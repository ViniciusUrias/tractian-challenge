# Tractian Challenge

The main goal of this project is to show how I built a custom data tree view in React.
It has a filter functionality, based on the tree nodes props, like status, id, name etc...


What would I have done if I had more time:
 - Improve performance by adding a virtualized view of the tree (using some lib like react-window)
 - Make it completely typed (utility functions, components, requests etc)
 - Applied CompoundComponent pattern to the tree component
 - Better way to make api calls and error handling (project.isBig ? 'react-query' : 'fetch')
 - Maybe add reduxtoolkit or some other state-management lib if we had more state or funcionality
 - Separate handlers and utils from UI components in pages (like home/index.tsx) 
 - Give more attention to the css and styles overall


Below we have a video demonstrating the project itself (low quality video cause gh only allows < 10mb)
